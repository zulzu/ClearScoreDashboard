# ClearScoreDashboard

A small iOS application in Swift that shows the credit score of a user. 

## How to run the app

There are no third party dependencies, just launch the app in Xcode. The app supports iPhones in portrait mode. There is no iPad support yet, however you should still be able to run it on an iPad in simulator mode.

## My main goals with the project

I wanted to have a simple app with all the bonus tasks like the animation and the detail page, using a simple design that follows the guidelines in the task description.

## Challenges

Although the app is really simple, I didn't want to upload the project without any tests, so I tried to set up everything with that in mind. 
Wanted to keep everything as simple as possible without using storyboards, pods, packages, etc.
Was thinking about trying out Lottie or something similar for the animation, but in the end I took the simplest route possible.

## Things to improve

Better design; more details to the detail page; better animation; animate the credit score too, not just the shape; maybe a nicer URL handling instead of the current hard coded one
